EGG stands for Early-career Glaciologists Group.  We are a grassroots collection of cryospheric scientists less than 5 years post-PhD, working under the umbrella of the [International Glaciological Society](igsoc.org).  We strive to provide representation for early career scientists within the IGS and in the broader scientific community.

# 1. Purpose and Duties of the IGS Early-Career Glaciologists’ Group (EGG)
## 1.1.
The EGG aims to advocate for the interests of early career glaciologists both within and outside the IGS, to promote participation in IGS-sponsored journals and symposia, and to provide representation in IGS governance for early career scientists studying snow and ice (defined loosely as scientists who are students or whose highest academic degree (PhD, MSc) was obtained within the last 5 years ).
## 1.2. Duties
### 1.2.1. 
Promoting the interests of early career scientists within the IGS
### 1.2.2. 
In cooperation with APECS, organizing special events at IGS symposia facilitating peer-to-peer and mentor-mentee networking.
### 1.2.3. 
Advocating for and providing for professional development for early career scientists within IGS.
### 1.2.4. 
Pursuing funding opportunities to help offset the costs of travel to IGS symposia and publication in IGS journals by early career glaciologists.
### 1.2.5. 
Advising the IGS executive committee regarding pathways towards improving the society’s responsiveness to early career researchers.
# 2. Relation to IGS mission:
The EGG supports the IGS’ mission ‘to stimulate interest in and encourage research into
the scientific and technical problems of snow and ice in all countries’ by promoting
scholarship in glaciology by a steadily-increasing portion of the scientific community:
early career researchers. The EGG facilitates the flow of glaciological ideas and
information by working to enhance opportunities for communication and collaboration
amongst the next generation of glaciologists.
# 3. Membership
## 3.1. Number of Members
The committee shall consist of five (5) members.
## 3.2. Membership Composition
The committee shall be composed of IGS members. In recognition of the moral and practical need for diverse viewpoints and membership, as well as the fundamental international nature of the IGS, the EGG will actively promote diversity with respect to geographic origins, gender, and research interests among committee membership.
## 3.3. Election of Members
Committee members shall be nominated (by themself or otherwise) following an open call. The first round of EGG membership will be selected by the IGS Council. Ongoing committee composition will be determined by open nominationcall, but with the existing committee members recommending the next round of members subject to approval by the IGS Council. The committee membership term shall be two (2) years, and membership may be renewed for an additional two (2) years.
## 3.4. Chair
The committee shall elect a chair by majority vote amongst committee members. The term of the chair shall be one (1) year. Responsibilities of the chair include:
### 3.4.1. 
Serving as ex-officio member in the IGS Council member, in case the chair is not a Council member
### 3.4.2. 
Submitting an annual report on EGG activities to IGS (see 5.1)
### 3.4.3. 
Breaking ties within the committee (the chair’s vote counts as 1.5 votes).
### 3.4.4.

## 4.5. Minutes
Meeting minutes shall be recorded and be distributed to committee membership and to the IGS Council no more than three (3) weeks after the conclusion of a EGG meeting.
# 5. Reporting
## 5.1. Annual report on the state of early career glaciology
Pursuant to its goal of providing the IGS a better understanding of early career scientists’ perspectives on the state of the IGS and on the state of snow and ice research as a whole, the EGG will provide an annual report composed of the committee’s activities, it’s plans for the next year, a summary of concerns amongst early career scientists regarding research in glaciology and within the scientific community as a whole, and suggestions for ways in which the IGS as a whole might better represent early career glaciologists. This report will be presented to the the IGS General Secretary several weeks prior to the IGS Council’s annual meeting, with the EGG chair attending the meeting in order to take questions and provide clarification on the committee’s report.
# 6. Revisions to the ToR
## 6.1.
The ToR and any future revisions must be approved by the EGG and the IGS
Council.
