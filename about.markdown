Welcome to the Early-Career Glaciology Group (EGG) within the IGS

The EGG is open to any ECS (Early-Career Scientist) in glaciology or related snow and ice sciences. Our aims are to enhance the cryosphere ECS community (socially and professionally), particularly within the IGS, and to provide additional support to ECS in cryosphere-related fields. 

We’re planning social events, workshops, and panel discussions at upcoming meetings (IGS and others). Through holding these events, we are hoping to build a better community for us ECS, where we can exchange ideas and discuss problems, foster career development, and get to know each other and benefit from this network. We also hope that through encouraging the IGS to provide more support for ECS, this support will help ECS with become more involved with and benefit more from the IGS. 

Am I an ECS?

We’re happy for anyone self-identifying as early career to get involved. We do want to make sure we’re creating a group for researchers at early stages of their career and therefore working through similar problems, including getting started on publications, learning how to apply for funding, presenting at conferences, and thinking about future career paths. We will likely adapt the IGS definition of early career — being in school or <6 years beyond a degree (with an extra year per child if you took time off to be the primary caregiver) — as we look to include funding opportunities. 

Mailing list and Twitter:

We will post information about upcoming events and opportunities on Twitter through @igsegg, and if you would like to receive emails about news and upcoming events please sign up [here](www.igsegg.org/join).
