The New Zealand branch had our annual meeting 3 - 5 February, held this year on Matiu Somes Island. We had an EGG mixer on the first evening, which included drinks provided by the local brewery Garage Project, and Good Buzz Kombucha. The mixer gave students new to NZ branch meetings an opportunity to meet everyone. We also asked for suggestions for future EGG events, and what students would like from the group, whose aim is to provide more support and community for young glaciologists.
