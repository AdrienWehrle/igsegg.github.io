# ECS come-together at the IGS British Branch September 2019

## September 4-5th 2019 at Northumbria University, Newcastle 

The British Branch of the IGS is meeting once a year, this yearâ€™s meeting was held at Northumbria University in Newcastle. The meeting took place over two days, with talks spread over the two days and a poster session before the symposium dinner on the first meeting day.

A ECS come-together was organized during the lunchbreak of the first day, giving the ECS the chance to get to know each other, where they are based and what their PhD is focussing on. We got very positive feedback from this event and will try to make an ECS come-together a regular event at IGS meetings and symposia.
